# IIC3675 Reinforcement Learning - Tabular Methods

This project implements and compares various tabular reinforcement learning algorithms, including Q-Learning, SARSA, and n-step SARSA, in the context of solving environments
The goal of this assignment is to explore and compare the performance of different tabular reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Usage
To run the code and visualize the results:

```bash
python main_c.py
```
This will execute the main script for task c. 

For the remaining tasks, substitute `main_c.py` with the appropriate script name:

- `main_d.py`: Task d
- `main_e.py`: Task e
- `main_f.py`: Task f
- `main_g1.py`: Task g, experiment 1
- `main_g2.py`: Task g, experiment 2
- `main_g3.py`: Task g, experiment 3

## Results
The results of the experiments are saved in the `results` directory. However a proper plotting script is not provided without running the code.

Analysis of the results are discussed and summarized in the report.
